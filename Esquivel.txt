The computer font Esquivel is © 1999 Harold Lohner.  All Rights Reserved.

Inspired by the OLD Esquire® magazine logo, c. 1968.  All letters and numbers guaranteed hand-drawn by me.  No further associated with the magazine, its copyright or trademark holders, should be inferred.  

Do not attempt to use this to produce your own Esquire magazine.  Use it to write other stuff.

Named after the great Mexican bandleader, composer, and arranger Juan Garcia Esquivel.

There are two versions, each with numbers, punctuation, and international characters.  THe trial version contains portions of both the regular and engraved versions.

SHAREWARE!!  For a modest $5 US shareware fee, I'll send you complete versions of both fonts.  E-mail me for my address.
